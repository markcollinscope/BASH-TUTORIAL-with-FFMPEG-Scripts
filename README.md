Includes for scripts to manipulate video files using ffmpeg.
Contact: markcollinscope@gmail.com

In this reposiory:
-	powerpoint version of slides (google docs link available on request).
-	some example scripts that manipulate video format files (add timecodes, concatenate videos, etc).
-	utils.shi - a ragbag of utility functions I've found useful over the years. For inclusion in scripts (using '.').

utils.shi is now depreciated. See the top level repository BASH UTILS - UTILITIES TO MAKE WRITING COMPLEX BASH SCRIPTS EASY.
